--- Day 3: Toboggan Trajectory ---
From your starting position at the top-left,
check the position that is right 3 and down 1.
Then, check the position that is right 3 and down 1 from there,
and so on until you go past the bottom of the map.

The locations you'd check in the above example are marked here with O
where there was an open square and X where there was a tree.

UPDATE - Initial thoughts were incorrect because value of treeSpotX did not reset to zero
once it reached end of row line.
Initial thoughts:
Hmm, needed steps seem to be:
 read the file/get lines

	check each character, to see if its a X - tree

	line i	find tree in character
	0 		3
	1		3
	2		6
	3		9
	4		12

	Pattern ?
